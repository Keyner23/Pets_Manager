# TASK MANAGEMENT APP â€” JSON-SERVER

This is a task management app that allows students to create tasks and teachers to view and grade them. The app uses **login with roles**, so users are redirected to different dashboards depending on their profile (student or teacher). All data is stored and managed through **JSON-Server** using GET, POST, and filtered queries.
